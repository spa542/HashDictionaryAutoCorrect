Project Description:
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the multiplication hash function.
This program takes in file of words and hashes them out using a modified multiplication
hashing function. All these words are then used as suggested word edits for a 
sentence that is input by the user. The sentence is corrected and then some 
statistics are posted afterwards.
**Bonus color output completed**

Files to pay attention to:

main.o HashList.o, Dictionary.o - These are the compilation linker files

hashdict - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific
commands

english.txt - Sample dictionary file with a large amount of words, any text file 
dictionary can work

Makefile Instructions:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything for you. Then
proceed with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If 
not using Makefile, then you must compile the .cpp files into .o files. 
(g++ -c main.cpp) Then you mus tlink those with a final compilation all while labeling
the output file as hashdict
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
**Example english.txt file needs specific format

english.txt Format:

START OF FILE
*
*
word
*
*
END OF FILE

**Formated one word a line and hyphens between words that must be separated
